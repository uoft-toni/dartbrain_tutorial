# DartBrains Lite

These tutorials are a subset of directly copied and heavily edited scripts from the [DartBrains course on neuroimaging analysis](https://dartbrains.org/content/intro.html). As such, all credit goes to [Luke Chang](http://www.lukejchang.com/) who developed DartBrains and the [nltools](https://nltools.org/index.html) python package. 

**Purpose:** This "lite" version of DartBrains is to provide interested ToNI users with a quick introduction focused more on the python code and how to use nltools.
